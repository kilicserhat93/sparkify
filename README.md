3- Libraries:
  Libraries used during the project are pyspark, datetime, matplotlib, pyspark ml, pyspark mllib, numpy, pandas and seaborn.

4- Summary:
  In this project I tried to predict the most risky users who can churn from our music app.
  In this project churn for us means users interaction with the "Cancelling Confirmation" page.  
  I analyzed the data, cleaned it, transformed it. I used some machine learning classification algorithms to predict the churners.
